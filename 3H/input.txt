We take off into the cosmos, ready for anything: for solitude, for hardship, for exhaustion, death.
Modesty forbids us to say so, but there are times when we think pretty well of ourselves. And yet,
if we examine it more closely, our enthusiasm turns out to be all a sham. We don't want to conquer
the cosmos, we simply want to extend the boundaries of Earth to the frontiers of the cosmos. For us,
such and such a planet is as arid as the Sahara, another as frozen as the North Pole, yet another as
lush as the Amazon basin. We are humanitarian and chivalrous; we don't want to enslave other races,
we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over their heritage in exchange. We think of
ourselves as the Knights of the Holy Contact. This is another lie. We are only seeking Man. We have
no need of other worlds. A single world, our own, suffices us; but we can't accept it for what it is.
We are searching for an ideal image of our own world: we go in quest of a planet, a civilization superior
to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past. At the same time, there is
something inside us which we don't like to face up to, from which we try to protect ourselves, but which
nevertheless remains, since we don't leave Earth in a state of primal innocence. We arrive here as we are
in reality, and when the page is turned and that reality is revealed to us - that part of our reality which
we would prefer to pass over in silence - then we don't like it anymore.
